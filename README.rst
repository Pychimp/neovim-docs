Neovim-Docs
===========

These docs are based off of the main and official neovim/docs repo.
These files are at `dc9d7ee488 <https://github.com/neovim/docs/commit/dc9d7ee48861a7102c50e4a34e2c7d39d5f20ade>`_
(cloned after @rjw57's latest pull-request that was merged into the official repo)

The plan is to convert them from the \*.txt into restructured text and markdown
format, on seperate branches, and which ever is needed,
can be merged into the master.


Two main reasons:

* Assumabily easier to maintain than vim's documentation format (Although, I may be wrong)
* Neovim might be able to render rst/md formats natively.

That's about it. Let's get cracking ! :smile:
